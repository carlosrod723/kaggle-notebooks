        "# **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques**\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is a part of the Kaggle competition **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**. The goal of this competition is to predict the final price of each house in Ames, Iowa, using various features describing residential homes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Competition Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this competition, we are provided with a dataset that includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Our task is to predict the final sale price of each home.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Evaluation Metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this competition, submissions are evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What is RMSE?**\n",
        "\n",
        "RMSE is a common metric used to measure the accuracy of a model's predictions. It is the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values. The formula for RMSE is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $ n $ is the number of observations\n",
        "- $ y_i $ is the actual value\n",
        "- $ \\hat{y}_i $ is the predicted value\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why Use RMSE?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- RMSE gives higher weight to larger errors, making it sensitive to outliers.\n",
        "- By taking the logarithm of the sales prices, we ensure that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses affect the result equally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Success Metric**\n",
        "\n",
        "For this competition, the goal is to minimize the RMSE between the logarithm of the predicted and observed sales prices. This means that the models will be evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict the log-transformed sale prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What does this mean?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Log-Transformation**: Instead of predicting the actual sale prices directly, the models will predict the log of the sale prices. This helps to handle the wide range of sale prices more effectively.\n",
        "- **Equal Weight for Errors**: Predicting the log of the prices ensures that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheaper houses are given equal weight. For example, predicting 300,000 when the actual price is 200,000 is as bad as predicting 150,000 when the actual price is 100,000 after taking the log.\n",
        "- **Goal**: The lower the RMSE, the better the model is at predicting the house prices accurately after taking the log transformation into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Data Source**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It serves as an excellent alternative to the often-cited Boston Housing dataset and provides a modernized and expanded version of it.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Id**: The dataset contains 1460 records, each identified by a unique Id.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LotFrontage**: The average lot frontage is approximately 70 feet, with a minimum of 21 feet and a maximum of 313 feet. There are some missing values (1201 out of 1460).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LotArea**: The average lot area is about 10,516 square feet, with a large standard deviation of 9981 square feet, indicating significant variability in lot sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OverallQual**: The overall quality of the houses ranges from 1 to 10, with a mean of 6.1. Most houses have a quality rating between 5 and 7.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OverallCond**: The overall condition ranges from 1 to 9, with a mean of 5.6. Most houses have a condition rating between 5 and 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **YearBuilt**: The houses were built between 1872 and 2010. The mean year built is 1971, indicating a mix of old and newer houses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **YearRemodAdd**: The mean year of the last remodel is 1985, with houses being remodeled as recently as 2010.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **MasVnrArea**: The average masonry veneer area is 104 square feet, but there is a wide range (0 to 1600 square feet). There are some missing values (1452 out of 1460).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TotalBsmtSF**: The total basement area averages 1057 square feet, ranging from 0 to 6110 square feet.\n",

        "- **GrLivArea**: The above-grade (ground) living area averages 1515 square feet, with a minimum of 334 and a maximum of 5642 square feet.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **GarageCars**: Most houses have garage space for 1 or 2 cars, with a mean of 1.77 cars.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **GarageArea**: The average garage area is 473 square feet, with a range from 0 to 1418 square feet.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **SalePrice**: The target variable (SalePrice) has a mean value of  180,921, with a minimum of 34,900 and a maximum of 755,000. The standard deviation is 79,442, indicating a wide range of house prices.\n",

        "- There is significant variability in some features, such as LotArea and GrLivArea, which could impact model performance.\n",
